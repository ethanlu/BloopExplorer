the BloopExplorer project was an Adobe FLEX app that provided a file exploration UI that was similar to Windows Explorer. This app was the primary method for mybloop.com users to manage the files that they have uploaded to the site. unfortunately, mybloop.com became increasingly difficult to sustain due to increasing costs, so the project was ultimately canceled. this repository is the last working version of the BloopExplorer subsystem. here for record keeping.
